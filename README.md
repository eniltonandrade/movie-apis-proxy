# Movie APIs Proxy

This application was built to serve as proxy to the two major movie information APIs that can be found on internet: [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) (The Movie Datadabase) API and OMDB, unofficial IMDB API made by [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
serve with hot reload at localhost:5000

```bash
npm run dev
```

serve with hot reload at localhost:5000

npm run build
```
